//things need to do:

// I need to reorganize the classes into different packages  
// need to write setters and getters for tool, thickness, color.
//for grid need to create two for loops, one for height and one for width and need to make sure that grid is always be on the top.
  // for grid need to use line2D class.
//packages should be like named as GUI, model, colorAction etc.

    //for(int i= 0; i < numberOfLines; i++){
